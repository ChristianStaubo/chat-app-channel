# Firebase Chat Room

## Description

This project is a chat room using Firebase's websocket and login authentication. The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Google's firebase and google cloud services, and as silly as it may sound; create it all from the documentation. I've created my own backends, and my own websocket server using socket.io before; but Google's Firebase made it really simple. I struggled a bit with the documentation at first, but got familiar quite quickly.
